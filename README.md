Backend Requirement: Our backend implements over a dozen routes, with each operation (GET, POST, DELETE) being implemented
at least once in one of the dozen routes. We have three tables for groups, users and posts in our database with users having
a many to many relationship with the groups and a one to many relationship with the posts. API Specification is in API_Spec.md.
